                                    Drawing on her transdisciplinary approach as well as precedents from art history from the 1970s onward, artist Marisa Morán Jahn expands how we think of the function of art. Rather than simply illustrating a concept, Jahn frames art-making as an integral process of critical, scientific inquiry; social transformation; and cultural esteem. 
                                </br></br>An artist of Ecuadorian and Chinese descent, Marisa Morán Jahn’s works redistribute power, “exemplifying the possibilities of art as social practice” (ArtForum). Jahn, who explores “civic spaces and the radical art of play” (Chicago Tribune), codesigns small to architectural and urban-scale projects with immigrant families, domestic workers, and public housing residents. Their public artwork, civic media tools, installations, films, architectural and urban-scale collaborations have engaged millions both on the street and at venues such as the United Nations, Tribeca Film Festival, Obama’s White House, Museum of Modern Art, and Venice Biennale of Architecture. Her work has received international media coverage in outlets including The New York Times, the BBC, Univision, Hyperallergic, Art in America, Architectural Review, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, PBS, and hundreds more. She has received grants and awards from Sundance, Creative Capital, and is currently an  Artist in Residence at The National Public Housing Museum, a Senior Researcher at MIT. Jahn has taught at Columbia University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (her alma mater), and Parsons/The New School where she is the Director of Integrated Design. With Rafi Segal, Jahn co-authored a book, Design & Solidarity (Columbia University Press, 2023) and co-founded Carehaus, the U.S.’s first care-based co-housing project (carehaus.net). She is represented by Sapar Contemporary.

                                    Energy has witnessed a surge of interest among historians and other scholars of society in recent years. This is not too surprising given the growing sense of urgency around our unfolding climate crisis, to which the extravagant burning of fossil fuels has been a leading contributor. Energy has thus been a compelling subject of study because of how important decisions related to its production and use will be to determining our collective present and future. At the same time, part of the appeal of energy has been its analytical promise. To environmental historian Richard White, it is a “protean and useful concept.” By following energy flows, one is able to weave together social and natural processes that are more commonly considered as separate threads. But the capaciousness of the energetic perspective presents its own challenge. In this talk, I set out to offer some reflections on the utility of placing energy at the center of our historical and social analyses, with particular attention to aspects of scale.
                                </br></br>The talk will be given in English and Q&A will be done in English and Chinese.

He is the author of Carbon Technocracy: Energy Regimes in Modern East Asia (University of Chicago Press, 2022), which uses the history of Asia’s onetime largest coal mine—the Fushun colliery in southern Manchuria—to explore the interplay of energy and power in the industrial age. Carbon Technocracy has received several awards, including the Association for Asian Studies’ John Whitney Hall Book Prize, the Chinese Historians in the United States’ Academic Excellence Award, and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations’ Michael H. Hunt Prize in International History. Victor is currently working on his next book, a history of industrial psychology in China.</p>

                                    當《科技、醫療與社會》於2011年在中興大學舉辦創刊十週年的工作坊時，筆者曾以「STS與現代史的相互渴望」為題在座談會中簡報。就如同歐美STS學界與科學史學界自1990年代起漸行漸遠，當時正在蓬勃發展中的台灣STS學界也很自然地開始呈現類似的走向，然而我隱然覺得，過早的分流可能會使雙方錯過作出重要學術貢獻的機會、以及來自對方的啟發。
                                </br></br>筆者將由當年開場的歷史圖像（出版於1847年）出發，分享自那時以來探索的初步成果，邀請大家討論「科技與現代東亞的歷史共構」之研究構想，希望能激發STS與現代史相互交流與合作的渴望。</p>

                                    We are now in the midst of what has been called a global "chip war," with China, the United States, and Taiwan considered to be the major players. This situation is the result of the globalization within the microelectronics industry that began in the 1960s. Southeast Asia was a major site for such outsourcing – US firms such as Fairchild Semiconductor, Hewlett Packard, and General Electric established factories in the region. This paper describes this “first wave” of outsourcing, examining the effects of these industries on work and life in the newly independent city state of Singapore. By analyzing the forms of work, patterns of family life, and development of urban space that arose within and around these factories, this talk aims to shed light on the long-term cultural and geopolitical effects of globalization within the microelectronics industries.
